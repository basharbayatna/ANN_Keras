# Machine Learning with Keras

This repository contains several Jupyter notebooks created using **Google Colab**, focused on building and understanding deep learning models with **Keras**. Each notebook demonstrates different types of neural network tasks such as regression, binary classification, and multiclass classification.

## 📚 Contents

- **Regression_in_Keras.ipynb**  
  Introduction to regression problems using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with Keras.

- **Binary_Classification_in_Keras.ipynb**  
  Implementation of a binary classification model using Keras, exploring activation functions, loss metrics, and evaluation methods.

- **Multiclass_Classification_in_Keras.ipynb**  
  A guide to solving multiclass classification problems, covering one-hot encoding, softmax output layers, and model performance evaluation.

- **HyperParameter_Keras.ipynb**  
  Demonstrates how to tune hyperparameters such as optimizers, dropout, and hidden units using Keras Tuner for better model performance.
